## 1. Overview

The SDK is an embedded workflow protocol scheduler, not a separately deployed business service. The host supplies final
content; the engine owns DAG execution, parallel scheduling, A2A envelopes, authentication, transport, waiting and
result association. Host callbacks choose whether/how to invoke A2A-T natural-language or structured content APIs.
Templates, schemas, LLMs and semantic validation belong to the host. The engine uses a2a-t-core only for canonical
negotiation context and metadata copying, not content generation.

The SDK in this diagram is a library embedded in the host-agent process, not a separately deployed orchestration
service:

1. The host agent receives and validates an inbound A2A task, then prepares the execution intent and business input.
2. The host agent obtains dispatched-agent cards from a registry and loads a `Workflow` from an orchestration center.
   `RegistryClient` and `LoadPsop` are optional helpers; discovery timing, caching, and failure policy remain host-agent
   responsibilities.
3. The host agent passes the `Workflow`, AgentCards, runtime intent, and callbacks to `ExecutePsop`. The engine walks the
   DAG, dispatches ready tasks concurrently, and handles Negotiation-T when required. `ControlPoint` returns business
   content, local results, routing decisions, and negotiation replies.
4. The host agent consumes `ExecutionResult` and returns or persists the final business result.
5. Authorization-T and Notification-T are invoked by the host agent at independent business times through
   `ExtensionSender`. They are outside the DAG and do not share a transport, runtime, or context with workflow tasks.

Local AgentCards and workflows are development fixtures, not production discovery or disaster-recovery rules. The
editable diagram source is
[`docs/diagrams/workflow-engine-surrounding-systems.mmd`](../diagrams/workflow-engine-surrounding-systems.mmd).

## 3. Layered Architecture

The SDK is structured in four layers. Each layer builds on the one below; each has a single responsibility and a clear
entry point.

```mermaid
graph TD
    L2["Layer 2 - Orchestration<br/>execute_psop / ExecutePsop<br/>lifecycle, event stream, cancellation, onFinish persistence"]
    L1["Layer 1 - Traversal<br/>WorkflowExecutor<br/>DAG walk, parallel dispatch, context assembly, routing"]
    L0["Layer 0 - Communication<br/>A2ATransport + two facades<br/>WorkflowEngineClient (workflow / standalone tasks) | ExtensionSender (independent operations)"]
    F["Foundation - Decision<br/>ControlPoint<br/>user-implemented business decisions"]

    L2 --> L1 --> L0
    L0 -.-> F
```

The layer view expands into the software module view (the engine in relation to the host agent, the orchestration center, the registry center, the dispatched agents, and the two SDK layers):

Key properties of the module view: the engine is embedded in the host process as a Maven dependency, started
by host code and extended through the callbacks. The scheduling kernel (core/control/model packages)
references no A2A-T SDK types — a boundary guarded by the `ContentDependencyBoundaryTest` architecture test.
The client protocol adaptation layer (A2ATExtension, A2atMessages, DefaultWorkflowEngineClient) is the only
place inside the engine that references a2a-t-sdk. All four interaction types with dispatched agents —
Task-T, Negotiation-T, Authorization-T, Notification-T — travel over a2a-java-sdk transports, with
authorization and subscription on channels independent of the workflow. The orchestration and registry
centers are only reached by the engine clients for workflow-definition search and AgentCard retrieval; the
selection strategy itself belongs to the host. A call rejected before task creation with a non-2xx
response and the standard A2A error envelope is detected by the transport layer and projected to a
stable error code (`a2a.<reason>`); it enters no negotiation and is not retried automatically. A
business failure after task creation is still reported as HTTP 200 with `TASK_STATE_FAILED`
carrying the failure evidence. Once a task is dispatched, a result that completes after the
callback budget expires or the run is cancelled is ignored and never sent to the remote agent.

### 3.1 Layer 0 - Communication

A2ATransport uses A2A SDK REST, JSON-RPC and gRPC bindings for authentication, delivery and complete response assembly.
WorkflowEngineClient accepts MessageContent for workflow or standalone tasks and manages task association, waiting,
negotiation continuation and non-final task cleanup. ExtensionSender
provides independent sendAuthorization and openNotification operations. The implementations are reusable; task,
authorization and notification do not share transport/runtime/context instances. ProtocolResponses assembles artifact
deltas by identity and ReceivedMessage preserves metadata at each level.

### 3.2 Layer 1 - Traversal

**`WorkflowExecutor`** walks the DAG. At each step it selects typed upstream results according to `contextFrom`
(`ContextBuilder`), dispatches subtasks concurrently, applies the step's success policy, and determines the next step
(s). It delegates every *decision* to
`ControlPoint` and every *send* to `WorkflowEngineClient`.

TaskRequest separates current input from workflowInput. ContextBuilder selects complete upstream views and convenience
outputs; it never formats or generates downstream content. The host decides how to consume them.

Step dispatch rules:

- Steps whose predecessors are all satisfied are collected and dispatched in parallel (`CompletableFuture`), so steps at
  the same layer run concurrently.
- Subtasks within a step also run in parallel.
- `ALL_SUCCESS` - all subtasks must succeed.
- `ANY_SUCCESS` - the first successful subtask wins; the rest are cancelled.
- `SELF_LOOP` - the task is handled locally via `onSelfTask`, with no A2A-T message sent to the agent.

### 3.3 Layer 2 - Orchestration

**`ExecutePsop`** is the high-level runner. It wraps the executor with a lifecycle (start / complete / error / close),
event serialization, client-disconnect cancellation, and an
`onFinish` persistence hook. Most integrations use this layer.

---

## 4. Decision Interfaces

```java
interface ControlPoint {
    CompletableFuture<MessageContent> onTask(TaskRequest request);
    CompletableFuture<TaskResult> onSelfTask(TaskRequest request);
    CompletableFuture<RouteDecision> onRoute(RouteRequest request);
    CompletableFuture<NegotiationReply> onNegotiation(NegotiationRequest request);
}
```

onTask returns final parts/metadata/extensions; the engine sends them without generating or rewriting content.
onSelfTask returns local TaskResult, onRoute independently allows or denies one conditional edge, and onNegotiation
returns Send or Stop. Unconditional edges bypass onRoute and always run. Unimplemented callbacks fail explicitly. No
echo-success, implicit route approval or automatic consent.
See [Business callback contract](BUSINESS_CALLBACKS.md) for fields and working examples.

## 5. A2A-T Extension Model

Task-T: the host generates final content; the engine envelopes and sends it. AgentCard declarations do not trigger
generation.

Negotiation-T:

The host business decides whether a task allows negotiation through the initial `MessageContent.extensions`. Neither
the AgentCard declaration nor the callback itself activates it. The engine only maps that selection to the message and
the `A2A-Extensions` request header, then manages subsequent negotiation correlation.

Only a remote `INPUT_REQUIRED` or a taskless bare message carrying a valid Negotiation-T Propose enters
`onNegotiation` (the latter is the A2A-T pre-task mode: correlated by contextId and negotiation id, with taskId-less
follow-up sends). Terminal responses never restart negotiation; ordinary `INPUT_REQUIRED` fails explicitly. Invalid
negotiation metadata on a bare message also fails explicitly instead of being treated as a normal response. The host validates/interprets the proposal and
generates the final Accept/Reject/Abort with its own A2A-T client. Use `A2atMessages.contextOf(request.received())` to
obtain the received context; reply with the same id, round and maxRounds. The last allowed round can still be answered.
Do not call nextRound for an ending reply or return a new Propose.

Return `new NegotiationReply.Send(content)` to send that exact content. Return `new NegotiationReply.Stop(code, reason)`
to stop without generating Abort content; the engine then cancels the known non-final A2A task as lifecycle cleanup.
Repeated task/session/round events do not repeat the callback or submission.
Unchanged waiting state is observed with getTask.
`maxNegotiationExchanges` (default 3) bounds local interactions, independently of the SDK context's maxRounds. Timeout,
exhausted budget or a missing handler fails locally; no implicit Accept or synthesized Abort. Accept/Reject ACKs in
SUBMITTED/WORKING remain pending and are observed without resending the command. A business-sent Abort is never
task success, even if the dispatched agent acknowledges it with COMPLETED.

Authorization-T and Notification-T are independent of the DAG. The host generates content and uses dedicated senders;
failure does not affect the workflow. Authorization policy controls only its own business action. Subscriptions stay
open until the host closes them.

## 6. Condition Routing

A step's `next` list holds `JumpCondition(step, condition)` entries. The routing rule is:

- **No `next`** - terminal; the step completes the branch.
- **Blank condition** - unconditional edge: activate it without calling `ControlPoint.onRoute`. Null, empty and
  whitespace-only values are all blank.
- **Nonblank condition** - conditional edge: invoke `ControlPoint.onRoute` once for that edge and activate it only when
  the returned `RouteDecision.allowed` is true.

All conditional edges are evaluated independently and may run concurrently. The engine waits for every decision before
atomically activating all unconditional and allowed conditional targets. Multiple true decisions therefore create a
parallel fan-out; all false decisions are valid and end the branch when no unconditional target exists. Callback
failure, timeout or null fails routing before any successor is dispatched. Route failures identify the source and target
edge and preserve the original cause. Duplicate targets from the same source are rejected during graph validation.

---

## 7. Event Model

Events are emitted to an optional `EventCallback` as stable string types (`EventType`). They are grouped by origin:

- **Runner lifecycle** - `start`, `complete`, `close`
- **Step / task execution** - `step_start`, `step_complete`, `task_request`,
  `task_response`, `task_status_changed`, `route_decision`,
  `workflow_complete`
- **Agent traffic** - `agent_request`, `agent_response`,
  `agent_status_update`, `agent_artifact_update`, `agent_message_event`
- **In-workflow A2A-T extensions** - `negotiation_request`, `negotiation_resolved`,
  `negotiation_failed`
- **Failure** - `error`, emitted on step failure by the executor and on final failure by the runner

`authorization_request`, `authorization_resolved`, and `notification` currently remain reserved
`EventType` constants; the workflow event stream does not emit them. Independent authorization results are handled
through the `ExtensionSender` result, and subscription events through the
`NotificationSubscription` callback.

```

## 9. Dependencies

workflow-engine uses A2A Java `1.2.0.Final` (REST/JSON-RPC/gRPC), a matching gRPC runtime,
`net.openan.a2a-t.sdk:a2a-t-core:1.1.0`, Jackson and SLF4J. Pure engine consumers do not transitively receive A2A-T
client/server, LLM, prompt or resources. Host agents explicitly depend on a2a-t-client; dispatched-agent services that
validate received content additionally use a2a-t-server. Registry/orchestration discovery is host-owned;
RegistryClient/LoadPsop are optional helpers.
Templates and slot schemas come from the pinned SDK jar, not sample resource overrides.

## 10. Design Decisions Summary

Final content is separate from protocol scheduling; hosts do not maintain A2A envelopes. Local multiple outputs and
complete remote evidence enter the selected upstream window without losing metadata or flattening arrays. Business owns
negotiation reply content; the engine owns association, deduplication and bounded waiting. Stop and Abort are distinct.
Pre-creation protocol errors are projected from the standard A2A error envelope to stable error codes; post-creation
business failures are reported through the task's terminal state.
Independent authorization/notification never gate the workflow; transport runtimes share the same callback contract. Protocol logs
observe actual boundaries with mandatory redaction; see [Integration guide](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).
