/**
 * Strategy for making typed negotiation decisions.
 *
 * <p>Single responsibility: when an agent requests negotiation (Negotiation-T) — either as a
 * task-anchored {@code INPUT_REQUIRED} status or as a taskless pre-task bare-message Propose —
 * produce the typed decision to send back. This is a <b>separate concern</b> from workflow
 * orchestration (task dispatch, routing). Users who need custom negotiation logic (LLM-based
 * decisions, DAG-predecessor forwarding, etc.) implement this interface and inject it into {@link
 * DefaultControlPoint} rather than mixing negotiation policy into their ControlPoint class.
 *
 * <p>The SDK's {@link ControlPoint#onNegotiation} remains the entry point for the auto-negotiation
 * loop; {@link DefaultControlPoint} delegates to an injected strategy by default. Users may still
 * override {@code onNegotiation} directly when a full strategy object is overkill.
