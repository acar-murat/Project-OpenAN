/**
 * Custom authentication provider for injecting auth headers into outgoing A2A messages.
 *
 * <p>Implement this interface when the agent's authentication is not covered by the credentials
 * file or the AgentCard's security schemes. For example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The AgentCard has no securitySchemes but the server still requires auth
 *   <li>The auth mechanism is not one of the A2A standard types (Bearer, API key, OAuth2)
 *   <li>Auth tokens come from an external identity provider (e.g. corporate SSO)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Register via {@link WorkflowEngineClientConfig.Builder#authProvider}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * WorkflowEngineClientConfig.builder()
 *     .authProvider((agentName, agentCard, headers) -> {
 *         String token = mySsoClient.getToken(agentName);
 *         headers.put("Authorization", "Bearer " + token);
 *     })
 *     .build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The provider is called for every message send, regardless of whether the AgentCard declares
 * security schemes. If both a credentials file and a custom AuthProvider are configured, their
 * headers are calculated independently and then merged. Different values for the same header name
 * are rejected with a {@link SecurityException}; no authentication source silently overwrites the
 * other.
